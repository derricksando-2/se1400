            <h2>Who are We</h2>
            <p>HTR Remodeling started with us, Rob and Hunter, a father and son who love working together on home projects. It all began in our own basement, where we spent countless hours turning ideas into reality. 

                Rob’s background in designing prototypes for products gave us a creative edge, while Hunter’s experience working for a high-end home builder brought the expertise we needed. After seeing the results of our hard work, we knew this was more than just a hobby, it was something we wanted to do for others. 
                
                That’s how we decided to start HTR Remodeling, combining our passion and skills to help families create spaces they truly love. Most of our business now comes from referrals, a testament to the trust and satisfaction we've built with our clients.</p>
